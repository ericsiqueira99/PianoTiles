# PianoTiles
I made this just for pure sake of it,
I really wanted to impress my brother proving I could outplay him on something,
so I choose to do it on the old phone game: Piano Tiles.
But, following our brotherhood history, I knew I had to find a good way to win this:
CODE!!!!!
The one thing my brother has not a slightest clue about
and the very few things i kinda feel comfortable with.
So I made python open this random website to play piano tiles
and click on whatever black pixel it finds on the first row and there we have it. 
Altough this went as far as 84 points, it was enough for 3 reasons:
1) I had fun
2) I made a cool video to annoy mmy brother
3) I realized he didn't care at all about the whole thing
Anyways....
I concluded yet another step on our (clearly one sided) chivalry
